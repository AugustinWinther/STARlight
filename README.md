# STARlight
This is the new repository for the STARlight Monte Carlo, which simulates ultra-peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions.   It simulates two-photon 
and coherent and incoherent photoproduction of vector mesons.  It also includes an interface to DPMJet to be able to simulate other, general photoproductio reactions.

The code was described "STARlight: A Monte Carlo simulation program for ultra-peripheral collisions of relativistic ions," by Spencer R. Klein, Joakim Nystrand, Janet Seger, 
Yuri Gorbunov and Joey Butterworth, Computer Physics Communications, 212, 258 (2017) [arXiv:1607.03838].
